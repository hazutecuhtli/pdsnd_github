### Project Title
*Udacity Project-Exploring Bikeshare data in R*

### Description
The objective of this project is to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities 
in the United States, **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington**. For this, several R libraries will be used, 
making use of the different functions that help with the analysis and processing of data based on this 
language. For example, ggplot, lemon and visdat will be used for visualizations, while fasDummies, 
dplyr and plyr will be used for the manipulation of data.

### Files used
Two are the main files used in this project:

- FunctionsR: File containing custom functions implemetned for this project
- Report: R notebook compose by the different steps needed for the processing and analysis of the data

### Sections of the Report

The report include in this project is composed by the following sections:

- Introduction
- Importing required libraries
- Reading data
- Preprocessing the data
- Exploring the data
- Clustering

### Conclusions

It can be concluded that the data provided for this analysis is useful to have an idea of how the bike-share systems work.
However, more information is required for a deeper analysis, one in which will be possible to forecast the use of the bikes. 
For this, it will be required prices, amount of time for the rent of the bikes, distance between stations, number of bikes
available at each station, amount of time since the user became a subscriber, condition of the bikes in the stations, among others. 
It is expected that with this information it will be possible to forecast the costs of operating each of the stations, and which station
to expand in order to increase the bike share system.
